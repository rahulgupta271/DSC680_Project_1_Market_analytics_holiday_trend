# Project Name: Market Analytics Holiday Trend

## Project Description: 
The method by which analytical data is generated and analyzed is Retail Data analysis. This information can be used to report on different facets of the supply chain operation in the retail chain, including purchases, returns, discounts, and more. This information is used by many suppliers, retailers, and marketing teams to identify patterns and learn more about their business. One of the main aspects of this form of growth in analytics in the retail industry is that when they shop, consumers have a more personalized experience [Jones, 2018]. Not just do retailers understand the needs and desires of their consumers better, but the behavior of their customers is just as significant.
